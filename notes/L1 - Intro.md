$P = \frac{1}{2} \cdot{C}\cdot{V^{2}}\cdot{f}\cdot{\alpha}$
Is the calculation used to find active power of a system

The `0.8 V` and `1.25 f` are maximum improvements, so if we only do `0.9V` and `1.1f`, then we end up with $P_{new} = .81 \cdot 1.1 P_{old} = .891 P_{old}$

Lowering the voltage is very important

But static power is what prevents us from lowering the voltage too much

## Static Power

- Can imagine voltage controls the valve through which static power "leaks"
- If Voltage is higher, dynamically spent power is high, doing computations and such
- If Voltage is low, there is not enough pressure to stop static power leakages through the transistor, which exits through many routes
- There is an optimal point on the total power consumption curve (the middle) where it is lowest

1. Most power-efficient setting is 0.9V at 1.8Ghz, giving us 21.39 P
2. The P for the highest performance settting is 101.25 P

## Fabrication Costs and Yield

- the number of chips you can fit on a silicon wafer determines the amount of revenue you can generate
- the number of defect chips impact that and is known as yield

- Large: 4x size/performance but 5x cost
- Huge: 16x size/performance but 500x cost

- if yield is 100%, then it would be exactly 100, but in the real world, it is 100+
